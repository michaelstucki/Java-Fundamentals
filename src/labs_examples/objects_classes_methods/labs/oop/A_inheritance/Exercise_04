Without running the code below, please tell me what it will print.

Answer: Parent called
1. c is of reference type Parent (the base or super class in this example).
2. c is assigned a reference to an object of type Child (the derived or subclass in this example).
3. so, while it's true that the subclass's doSomething method overrides its inherited superclass counterpart method,
   the superclass Parent type reference variable only has access to the doSomething method defined its own class.
In short, the base class reference only gives access to the methods defined in the base class.


public class InheritanceTest
{
  public static void main(String[] args)
  {
    Parent c = new Child();
    c.doSomething();
  }
}

class Parent
{
  public void doSomething()
  {
    System.err.println("Parent called");
  }
}

class Child extends Parent
{
  public void doSomething()
  {
    System.err.println("Child called");
  }
}
