Without running the code below, please tell me what will print. Why?

Answer:
Parent called
Child called

1. The superclass constructor (Parent()) is the first command run when the subclass constructor (Child()) is invoked.
2. When Parent() is run it prints "Parent called".
3. Then when Child() completes running it prints "Child called".
4. So, the printed messages are as noted.


public class InheritanceTest
{
  public static void main(String[] args)
  {
    Parent c = new Child();
  }
}

class Parent
{
  public Parent()
  {
    System.err.println("Parent called");
  }
}

class Child extends Parent
{
  public Child()
  {
    System.err.println("Child called");
  }
}
